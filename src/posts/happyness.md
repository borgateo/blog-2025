I spent 26 years in a small town between Padua and Venice. The routine was textbook: girlfriend, five-a-side football, boxing, same pizzerias, same jokes.

No complaints. _I felt lucky. Honestly._

## **Money 💶**

I jumped on the work train at 15. I wanted **independence**.

Also, growing up where a degree is seen as pointless, doesn’t exactly push you toward campus life.

Factories and construction sites left a mark. Great people, tough work. Enough to shove me back to the books. The idea of a lifetime on an assembly line? _Hard pass_. I loved computers and games. Obvious path.

<div align="center">❉</div>

**December 27, 2007. Freezing.**

I defend my thesis. Professor Sperduti declares me “Doctor of Mathematics and Computer Science.” Applause, hugs, the whole scene. Then...reality.

Job hunting isn’t hard. A few weeks later I’m a junior dev at a B2PA consultancy in Padua. Contract? **Metalworker.** Because Italy still hadn’t figured out what a software developer is.

> **Permanent contract** with **3-year apprenticeship**. <br/>
> **Salary:** €948 net/month.

They promise they’ll shorten the apprenticeship. _Maybe_.

I knew I was green. I wasn’t expecting money showers. And hey, none of my uni friends were cracking €1k. Real **“[1000 Euros Generation]”** energy.

## **A Decent Paycheck Can Wait 💔**

Two years later, with “seniority,” I’m at **€1,049**. The “shortened” apprenticeship? Magically “maturing” till the end. They “can’t afford” a full salary but will gladly pocket incentives. **Win-win**—just not for me.

Work felt like a straitjacket. Projects? _Anaesthetic_. Time to bail.

I interview everywhere. The offers? **+€100–€150/month**. Switching for crumbs? Meh.

The only perk: a **silky work-life balance** and **near-zero pressure**. Most people would be thrilled. _I’m not most people_. I’m young. I want more.

<div align="center">❉</div>

Another year flies by. Still chasing a bigger paycheck. **Nothing.** Meanwhile I’m doing support, help desk, full implementations. I’m proud. Also **underpaid** and **invisible**.

I’m a squirrel in a maze. Then a spark: _“What if I look outside Italy?”_

The mythical land where devs get paid. 🤑

## **The Second Job 🥈**

Enter Luca, a compatriot with a web agency in Lithuania. We collaborate nights and weekends.

Suddenly I’m getting pings from the Netherlands, India, Germany, the UK. Lightning strike: **English pays**.

Small issue: my English is **tragic**. I can barely stitch a sentence.

Solution: get good. **Fast**.

## **“Du iú spich inglisc?” 🥴**

Years of school and I can’t form a thought. _Classic._

I dust off high school books, raid my girlfriend’s uni materials, and find my dad’s cassette course. I loop it in the garden shed like a monk. My sidekick? **Google Translate**. We laughed, we cried, we invented new grammar.

## **Something Unexpected Happens ✨**

Chatting with my friend Stefano. There’s a startup in Amsterdam looking for a front-end dev.

“Interview?” **“Hell yes.”**

> _June 2011._ Front-end is a toddler. **jQuery**, **Mootools**, **Handlebars**. **AJAX** is going mainstream. **Backbone.js** organizes the chaos. Everyone chants **“MVC.”**

![When we were young](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FJ9ImmwXsAYygJU?format=png&name=900x900)

I’m solid with **CSS**, decent with **PHP**, semi-coherent with **JavaScript**. English? **Disaster**.

Phone interview = emotional rollercoaster. My mom’s impressed (she doesn’t speak English), but even she doubts they’ll hire me.

A week of remote trials later, contract lands:

> **Fixed-term:** 1 year.<br/>**Salary:** €2,249 net/month.

My brain:

- **Dead-end job?** Who cares.
- **International adventure?** Yes.
- **English upgrade?** Finally.
- **CV boost?** Needed.
- **Money?** At last.

**I quit on the spot.** Netherlands, _hier ik kom!_

They cover a **one-way flight**, **two weeks at [Hotel Casa Amsterdam]**, and a **MacBook Pro**. Dreamy.

I’d never been to the Netherlands. **July 31, 2011:** I land, ready for a year-long dive.

<div align="center">❉</div>

The honeymoon ends fast. The first months? **Brutal.** I barely understood anything. New culture, new habits, new colds. I was a fish on a bicycle.

<div class="grid gap-7 lg:grid-flow-col grid-flow-row grid-col-2">
  <img class="mx-auto my-0 py-0" src="/static/img/adam-min.jpg" title="Frozen Herengracht Canal, Amsterdam — Netherlands (2012)" />
  <img class="mx-auto my-0 py-0" src="/static/img/via-min.jpg" title="First flat, Sint Nicolaasstraat — Netherlands (2012)" />
</div>

But Amsterdam runs on **English**. So I committed. [Meetup], classes, friends, [Couch Surfing]. Canadians, Americans, Germans, Russians—everyone fluent but me. I figured fluency is contagious. Turns out, a bit.

Plenty of awkward moments. **Progress anyway.**

![Cultural evening — Netherlands (2012)](/static/img/groups-min.jpg)

<div align="center">❉</div>

I worked hard. Then startup roulette: dev team **downsized**. Most programmers out.

My first time getting the boot. Well—nudged, so they wouldn’t pay severance.

> **The world has wolves.** Noted.

## **Panic Mode: Activated! 😱**

Nine months in: **unemployed**, far from home, with toddler-level English.

I look up flights back. Then a switch flips: **I can do this.**

CVs fly. I hit meetups—**JavaScript**, **Frontend Developers**, **Hackers & Founders**, **hackathons**. I shake hands, drink bad coffee, keep showing up.

I make friends, build a network, and let the city know I exist.

**Hey Netherlands, I’m not leaving.**

![Rockstart Accelerator — Netherlands (2012)](/static/img/rockstart-min.jpg)

Before my termination even ends, a **new offer** lands. Not even that hard. **Momentum regained.**

The rest is **history in progress**.
<!-- [Part Two →](/posts/happiness-part-two) -->

## **TL;DR ⚡️**

Before you complain about your job, **breathe**.

Italy has **brilliant developers**.

> **Why stay where your work is undervalued?**

In Italy, devs are often treated like **button-pushers**. In reality, we’re **builders**, **designers**, **problem poets**.

Stale environments kill curiosity. It can happen anywhere—but you don’t have to stick around.

If your project drains you, pack your laptop and **change rooms**. Find the buzz. Don’t wait to hate your boss, your coworkers, and yourself.

The internet nuked borders. You don’t need Amsterdam or London to level up. Send a **sharp intro** and a **clean CV**. Costs nothing.

If you feel **underpaid** and **overlooked**, remember: **Germany, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the UK, Scandinavia**—endless options. Reignite the spark you felt writing your first _“Hello, World!”_

This time, you’ll mean it. **“[Hello, World!]”**
