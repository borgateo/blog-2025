Alright, gather 'round, partners! We're about to delve into the wild world of remote work, where [the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_good_the_bad_and_the_ugly) of internet connectivity await us!

## The Bad: Internet Connection Woes

Picture this: You're in a mesmerizing, remote location, and the only thing stressing you out is the darn internet connection! It's like trying to tame a wild stallion that has a mind of its own.

While everyone else is carefree on vacation, you're having a panic attack because your architectural meeting with department leaders is about to go down the drain, thanks to the internet outage. No bueno! üôÄ

And when you seek help from reception or the Airbnb host, they act like it's no big deal. "Hey, you're on vacation, man! Why sweat the internet? It can wait!" Oh, the nerve!

But fear not, my friends! I've got some savvy solutions for you.

### Prevention

Always have **backup plans ready to roll**. When you're working in unfamiliar territories, with diverse cultures and languages, you've got to be organized like a cowboy's holster.

Every minute spent troubleshooting these internet issues is less time to savor the beauty of your surroundings. 

> Value the Time, Partner. Always!

So, prepare yourself with these steps:

1. Before booking accommodations, demand a screenshot of the internet speed test(*) using [fast.com](https://fast.com).
2. Have a reliable mobile hotspot with a decent data plan from a local SIM card.
3. Know your escape routes! Scout the area for potential internet spots like a sprinting gunslinger! üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

*: Zoom only requires [1.5Mbps to use]((https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362023-System-requirements-for-Windows-macOS-and-Linux#h_d278c327-e03d-4896-b19a-96a8f3c0c69c)), but in my experience, connections below 5Mbps are not adequate for two-way interaction.
For a better experience, AT recommends speeds above 20Mbps.
In general, your internet service speeds should be in the 10 to 25 Mbps download speed range and at least 3 Mbps upload speed for the best results.
The _Ping_ isn't very important. It's more of a thing for gamers who want quick response times, otherwise, the game lags.

I've been through countless "return-to-the-stone-age" moments ü¶¥, but with these tricks up my sleeve, I've managed to keep my colleagues waiting for just a few minutes, most of the time.

However, let's be real. This stress could be minimized if we embraced the power of asynchronicity, my friends! 

### üì£ Say it with me: A-S-Y-N-C

Take that impressive architectural presentation, for instance. Share it as soon as it's ready and let your colleagues marinate on it.
They'll articulate their feedback more thoughtfully and intelligently when given the time.

Meetings can often be transformed into asynchronous conversations too. And those often useless stand-ups?
Let's free ourselves from that burden and dedicate more time to coding, my fellow programmers! üèÜ

In the vast remote landscape, it's easy to forget the [value of casual chatter](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75553). We're setting up a virtual [water cooler](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAparymJ_jc) (a.k.a. non-obligatory calls) where we can chit-chat about hobbies, food, kids, and travels. It's like a refreshing social oasis amidst our busy work environment, fostering camaraderie and enhancing cohesion.

It's been [downright proven](https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation.aspx?paperid=75553) that gossip within a team can actually do wonders for strengthenin' them bonds and fosterin' a sense of togetherness.

Now, I reckon some folks might scratch their heads and raise an eyebrow at this notion, but hear me out! Just like cowboys sharing stories 'round a campfire üèïÔ∏èüî• these chatty exchanges create a web of connections and fellowship.

## The Ugly: FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out)

As our company grows, so does our Slack channel count, and boy, it's overwhelming!
The brainiacs say we can't handle more than 150 interpersonal connections ([Dunbar's Number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number)), but here we are with 574 channels to keep up with, some crucial like `#security`, `#engineering`, and `#alerts`, while others are, let's say, less mission-critical like `#petlovers` and `#cooking`.
(What? We all need a little fluff and spice in our work lives!)

But managing these important channels is no walk in the park. It takes the energy of a rodeo cowboy to follow every conversation, filter out the crucial information, and keep our productivity from bucking us off.

Imagine having to stay up-to-date with the latest technologies, libraries, APIs, frameworks, and every darn product update!

I've even wondered if I should hire a dedicated Slack Sherpa to navigate this digital wilderness and report back to me at day's end.

It ain't designed for this kinda business.

> Slack's just a darn chat, plain and simple!

It's good for quick chit-chats, but when the stakes are high, we can't be pourin' our hearts out in an app where a kitten gif takes up more vertical space than a dang DB update notification.

Plus, after just 5 minutes, your message is lost in the scrollin' wilderness, buried beneath all them other words.

That's why we're fixing to embrace tools like Confluence, Dropbox Paper, Obsidian or Notion. 
You know, the kinda tools where we can keep our documentation all nice and tidy, just like a well-organized saddlebag.

Now, in my humble opinion, this solution ain't exactly perfect, but it's a sight better than Slack. Things seem more orderly and accessible, if ya ask me.

But here's the real deal, folks. The company's gotta rid itself of this pressure. There's no use in forcin' the employees to keep up with every darn choice, projection, and decision that comes down the trail.

It's only natural that a colleague might not know that the Accounts team's addin' a feature flag to the profile management section, or that the Migration team's puttin' a primary key in the restrictions table.

The important thing is for them leaders to promote this awareness, set a good example, and repeat the news like a broken record, filterin' out the useful info from the useless with some good old-fashioned sense.
Let's focus on what truly matters.

## The Good: Freedom!

Here's the silver lining, folks! While the pressures of remote work may lurk outside, they're just that ‚Äì outside. You have the power to put on the "Do Not Disturb" hat in Slack and enjoy some blissful silence.

No more interruptions from pesky colleagues seeking "super quick" favors that eat up half your day! Ha!

Of course, there might still be distractions from partners, kids, or furry friends at home, but that's a whole different adventure for another day!

So, take these tips to heart and transform your remote work culture into a thriving, enjoyable environment for you and your beloved colleagues. Happy trails, partners! ü§†üèïÔ∏è
